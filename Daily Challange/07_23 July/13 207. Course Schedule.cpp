/*
        207. Course Schedule
        

        There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.


	For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.


Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 
Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.


Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= numCourses <= 2000
	0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
	prerequisites[i].length == 2
	0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
	All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.
